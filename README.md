# LongTermUnemploymentStatistics
Timeseries, Aggregation, and Filters in Tableau

<b> Challenge: </b>
Given time series unemployment data in the USA from 2005 to 2015, visualize the unemployment by age group and gender.

<b> What did we learn? </b>
1. Difference of using a time column as a dimension/categorical variable or a measure/numerical variable.
2. Tableau figures out the granularity level by looking at our worksheet. Usually, measures get aggregated and dimensions give the granularity level.
3. How to turn off/on aggregation.
4. How to change the aggregation function.
5. Using 'detail' to increase level of granularity.
6. Highlighting a certain class.
7. How to add and show filters.
8. Customize filter(single/multiple options, remove all functionality from customize).
9. When to use extract/live data?
